    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Note we describe the sequence of LSST data management (DM) software stack calls needed to emulate the expected Data Release Processing (DRP) pipeline. These recipes were initially developed for the Twinkles project, the pathfinder for the first LSST DESC data challenge, DC1, and were later adapted for the main DC1 simulation. We provide links to the original DC1 recipes at the appropriate points below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target DRP pipeline is described in the LSST Project document [LDM-151](ls.st/ldm-151), _\"LSST Data Management Science Pipelines Design.\"_ We will refer to this document extensively, importing figures and quoting from it as needed. In DC1, the simulated images that we produced were so-called \"e-images\", ecah one of which emulates a calibrated frame; in DC2, we will produce amplifier (science) and accompanying calibration images, and extend the Twinkles pipeline to include instrument signature removal. We also adopt the recently developed object association code, in order to make `DIAObjects` from our `DIASources`. Other than these two extensions, we expect the DC2 DM pipeline to look similar to the DC1 pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='toc'></a>\n",
    "This Note is organized as follows. We first provide an [overview](#overview) of the DRP pipeline, summarizing the relevant section in [LDM-151](ls.st/ldm-151). Then, we present the recipes in three sections: \n",
    "1. [Image Coaddition and Object Detection](#coadds)\n",
    "2. [Difference Image Analysis and DIASource Detection](#diasources)\n",
    "3. [DIAObject Generation and Light Curve Forced Photometry](#forcedphot)\n",

    "We then provide some brief [concluding remarks](#conclusions).  "

    "Anticipating that difference image analysis (DIA) will not be required in the DC2 main survey area, it makes sense to preserve the DC1 grouping of the DRP pipelines, into static sky and dynamic sky pipelines. \n",
    "  * The static sky analysis involves image characterization, calibration and coaddition followed by `Object` generation and measurement. \n",
    "  * The dynamic sky analysis makes use of the calibrated images, but involves 1) the construction of a `TemplateCoadd` image followed by image differencing, `DIASource` detection in the difference images, and then 2) association of those `DIASources` into `DIAObjects` which then form the target positions for forced photometry. Light curves can then be extracted from the `DIAForcedSource` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, multi-epoch object characterization is not yet available in the DM stack. As a result, the `Objects` are the same as the \"Preliminary Objects\", and are made by detecting sources in the `Coadd` images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there will be difference image analysis (DIA) carried out in both the Alert Production and Data Release Processing pipelines. The main difference is that the APP will need to build `DIAObjects` on the fly, while the DRP will have all data available to it at once, after the fact. The DRP can make the best possible `TemplateCoadd` reference image, and then generate new `DIASources` and aggregate them into new, \"reprocessed\" `DIAObjects` ready for a single pass of forced photometry at their locations of all these reprocessed `DIAObjects`, which will result in light curves extending over the duration of the whole survey to that point.  As in Twinkles, in DC2 our goal for the dynamic sky analysis is to emulate the production of cosmology-ready LSST supernova and lensed quasar light curves, which is why we retain the focus on the _data release reprocessing_ of the visit images."

    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to make is the sky map on which the coadded images will be projected for all bands. In order to ensure that the sky map will not depend on the list of input visits (their location on the sky or on the time and place the reprocessing happens), the sky map should be absolute (using `makeSkyMap.py` and the appropriate configuration) instead of relative to an input field (as done with `makeDiscreteSkyMap.py`). Making such a sky map will create thousands of tracts and patches, that will be fixed on the sky and usable in different reprocessing sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility could be to use the [Rings sky map](https://github.com/lsst/skymap/blob/master/python/lsst/skymap/ringsSkyMap.py#L42), as done for the HSC data reprocessing with the LSST stack (and currently for CFHT data reprocessing as well). In order to make this sky map, some modifications of the `lsstSimMapper.py` [script](https://github.com/lsst/obs_lsstSim/blob/master/python/lsst/obs/lsstSim/lsstSimMapper.py) must be done to match what has been done in `hasMapper.py` ([here](https://github.com/lsst/skymap/blob/master/python/lsst/skymap/ringsSkyMap.py#L42) and [here](https://github.com/lsst/obs_subaru/blob/master/python/lsst/obs/hsc/hscMapper.py#L286)). A configuration file (`makeSkyMapConfig.py` below) is then needed to run `makeSkyMap.py`, containing information on how to parametrize the rings map. An example of such a configuration can be taken from the HSC reprocessing [repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/ReprocessingTaskForce/blob/master/config/w_2017_49/cfht/makeSkyMapConfig.py), which contains:\n",

    "This requires a manual config step.  The seeing in the data varies from visit to visit.  For image differencing to work well in the current system, the template should have sharper seeing than the science images.  Thus, we choose a subset of the calibrated visit images to construct the coadd.  More data will give us higher signal to noise, but a wider coadd PSF.  Less data allows for a sharper coadd PSF, but lower signal to noise.  We have decided to parameterize this choice by allowing the maximum acceptable seeing in pixels, `select.maxPsfFwhm`, to be set at runtime.  The FWHM of the model Psf, `modelPsf.defaultFwhm`, also needs to be set, and must reflect this choice.  In concrete terms, `modelPsf.defaultFwhm` must be equal to or greater than `select.maxPsfFwhm`, and we recommend they be set to be equal to minimize loss to the broader coadd PSF.\n",
