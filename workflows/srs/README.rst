Directory structure
-------------------

Here is an attempt to organise the data and softwares at CC-IN2P3::

  Raw data : /sps/lsst/datasets/desc/DC2/Run?.?

  Producted data set: /sps/lsst/data/desc/DC2/Run?.?

  Dedicated software: /pbs/throng/lsst/software/desc/DC2/Run?.?

  DM stack: /sps/lsst/software/lsst_distrib/w_2018_??

In each `DC2` folders will be found several sub-folders corresponding
to the different runs carries out during the test and production
phases (Run1.1, Run1.2, Run1.etc) The `dedicated software` folder and
its content will only be modifiable by a handful of people (Dominique,
Johann, Fabio, Nicolas) through the modification of its Access Control
List (ACL).
