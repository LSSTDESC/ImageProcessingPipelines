This directory contains the setup_desc_drp.sh script which installs the current
set of ancillary packages necessary for the SRS workflow, beyond a vanilla
DMstack installation.

To Use:
source setup_desc_drp.sh <fullpath to installation directory>

The installation directory will store the additional installed packages for
use in the DMstack's conda environment.

The dm-constraints*.txt file contains the current list of DM python package
versions. This constraints file is utilized in the setup_desc_drp.sh script
to enforce the DM python package versions, rather than allowing them to 
potentially being upgraded.
